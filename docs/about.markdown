## Taylorzyx Isotope Zone

An explorer, developer.

This website is a place to share thoughts and 'know-how' during my studies and work.

[Isotope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope) basically is a group of atoms that shares the same values but differs
in outer shapes.

If you are interested you can find me [on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yxzh/) and [github](https://github.com/taylorzhangyx)
